    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about">
      <p>I’m Harshini Choudhary — a curious mind where data meets design and creativity meets precision. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Arya College of Engineering & I.T., Jaipur. <br><br>I’m passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights and real-world impact. I love exploring the intersection of technology, innovation, and art — combining analytical thinking with storytelling, problem-solving, and creativity. From working on data projects to expressing myself through music, design, and content, I see every skill as part of one larger vision: to create, inspire, and evolve. I’m driven by discipline, curiosity, and a deep belief in lifelong learning. <br><br>My goal is to build a future that blends intelligence with imagination — where every idea is executed with purpose and every challenge becomes an opportunity to grow.</p>
